Spotlight the Usurper to describe the Usurper's assault and tick down this countdown by 1. If the Usurper takes Major or greater damage, tick up the countdown by 1. When it triggers, the Usurper shatters the barrier between the Mortal Realm and the Hallows Above to slay the gods and take their place. You gain a Fear for each unmarked HP the Usurper has. You can immediately use the \"Godslayer\" feature without spending Fear to make an additional GM move. How does the Mortal Realm writhe as the natural order is violated? What mortals witness this blasphemy from afar?"
